# Games Web Application

[See the web application here!](https://intense-journey-49547-3965d03e6dee.herokuapp.com/)

**Status:** Web app deployed (see above). Currently working on porting React. README and web application subject to change.

- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Node.js, Express.js, Axios, Mongoose, EJS
- **Tools/Markup:** RESTful Routing, HTML, CSS
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL), Mongo Atlas
- **API's:** IGDB REST API

## Overview

Worked independently on a personal full-stack web application, utilizing a wide array of libraries and frameworks. This web application uses the IGDB REST API to render video-game multimedia, and contains functionality such as: authentication, authorization, leave reviews/comments, view multimedia, and full CRUD functionality.

This project is a work in progress, where updates are made when I have free time. Furthermore, I am porting React.js to the project, replacing Embedded JavaScript Templates (EJS).

## Features

- Browse a collection of video games using a user-friendly interface.
- View detailed game information, screenshots, and trailers.

Additionally, the application now includes client side, as well as server side validation. This occurs when a user creates a new game, or edits one. Also worth noting, the web app currently offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for video games. Users can perform these actions on game entries, and the system stores and retrieves the data effectively.

Finally, users can now leave comments, as well as upload images for a game.

## To-Do List

- Port React.js, replacing EJS.
