## Overview

Welcome to the Games web application, a personal project of mine that aims to create an engaging platform for gamers to discover, explore, and interact with their favorite video games. The application utilizes various technologies to provide an immersive experience, including Node.js, Express.js, Axios, Mongoose, EJS, and MongoDB as the NoSQL database. Additionally, the IGDB (Internet Game Database) and Twitch APIs are integrated to fetch game information and media.

## Features

- Browse a vast collection of video games using a user-friendly interface.
- View detailed game information, screenshots, and trailers.
- Leave reviews and ratings for your favorite games.
- Planned: User registration, personalized playlists, and more exciting features!

## Current Progress

### Client side and server side Validation

The application now includes client side, as well as server side validation. This occurs when a user creates a new game, or edits one.

### CRUD Functionality

The application currently offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for video games. Users can perform these actions on game entries, and the system stores and retrieves the data effectively.

### User Favorites Feature

Under development is the user favorites feature, allowing users to curate a list of their preferred games. This feature will enhance personalization and engagement within the application.

### Navigation Bar

A work-in-progress navigation bar is being designed to ensure smooth and intuitive user navigation. Expect improvements in the upcoming updates.

## To-Do List

Here's a glimpse of what's on the horizon for the Games Web App application:

- Incorporate a powerful search bar for quick game access.
- Craft a fully-designed custom template for a polished look.
- And much more to come as the application evolves!
